Project breakdown:
- [x] Back-end: FastAPI
- [x] Front-end: React + TypeScript
- [x] Tests

### Back-end

FastAPI: 
- [x] web framework created in 2018
- [x] enables to create RESTful API in Python

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

#### Endpoints

#### About RESTful API

Architectural style for designing networked applications.
Key characteristics:
- [x] resource-based, e.g. resources are identified by unique URIs -> `/users/{user_id}`
- [x] CRUD Operations: Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT/PATCH), Delete (DELETE)
- [x] Stateless: server does not maintain any client state between requests
- [x] Uniform Interface: w/ standard HTTP methods, status codes, media types for representing data (JSON or XML)
- [x] Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)
- [x] Cacheable:
